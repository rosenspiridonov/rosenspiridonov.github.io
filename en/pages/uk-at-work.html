                        Globalisation could be described as the complex process of the world becoming increasingly
                        interconnected as a result of economics, politics and cultural exchange worldwide. Globalising
                        processes are affected every day by what is happening around the globe with business, economics,
                        nature, work organization and more.

                Globalisation in itself mainly includes integration of local and national economies into the global
                market. Economically, globalization involves goods, services, the economic resources of capital,
                technology and data.
                The economies of the UK and the USA have several features in common. Their manufacturing sectors have
                declined while service industries have been and are on the rise.

                    Being the birthplace of the industrial Revolution, the UK had no rival for much of the 19th century.
                    In the 20th century it was overtaken by other countries. However, since the 1990s things have
                    started to look better:

                                UK farms don’t have high employment, but produce about 60% of the nation’s food. The
                                lowland areas are more fertile and produce more crops, especially wheat and barley. The
                                upland territories are mostly used for raising sheep and cattle. Forests cover about 12%
                                of the land.

                                Fishing is an important industry along the North Sea coast, however it is not at its
                                best state since there has been a decline in fish stocks and increasing competition from
                                foreign fishing fleets.

                                Most of the coal and iron ore mines, which helped make the UK become world’s leading
                                economy have closed down and the UK now imports these materials. Similarly, the
                                resources of oil and gas, from which the UK has benefited for the last 30 years are
                                diminishing and the country has to rely on imports. There have been plans to increase
                                production of energy from renewable sources in order to reduce emissions and greenhouse
                                gases.

                                Most of the industries, which the UK was once famous for, for example production of
                                textiles, steel, machinery an ships have also declined. Today the UK still manufactures
                                a variety of products, however the whole industry and the people working in it have
                                declined. Attention has been drawn towards service industries. In spite of this fact,
                                there are several manufacturing industries which are still relevant.

                                Foreign trade is essential for UK’s economy. The country exports lots of goods and
                                services. There include machinery, chemicals, electronics and oil. UK also imports many
                                of the same goods as well as food and raw materials.

                    Britain used to be called world’s “workshop”. They not only produces all kinds of goods themselves,
                    they also managed to transform them into finished products. Nowadays almost all of the coal mines,
                    shipyards, steelworks and cotton mills are gone. In the 1970s over 30% of UK’s income came from
                    manufacturing and it employed 7 million people. Today the percentage is 11 and employed people are
                    only 2.5 million. Instead of producing its own goods, the country imports everything from China.
                    Most of the people have moved to working in the service industry. However cleaner and safer today’s
                    workplaces might be, many people still look back with nostalgia to the old days when they had “real
                    jobs”. The historian Paul Kennedy talks about the sheer satisfaction about manufacturing ships. When
                    a new ship was being launched, the kids went out to see what their fathers had put together. Many
                    manufactories from the past have turned into wastelands.

                        people. There are 690,000 registered nurses, most of which are women. Their hard work is highly
                        underpaid. Research shows that:

                        A registered nurse talks about the situation. She describes how the nurses work on a rotational
                        basis, so they work 5 weeks of day shifts and 1 week of night shifts. Her daily work involves
                        talking to the staff and the patients, check the patients’ records, do paperwork and have
                        meetings with nurses or doctors.
