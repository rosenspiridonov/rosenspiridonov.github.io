                    Back in the 1970s wonderful employment prospects were predicted. After the dropped birth rate after WWII and the baby boom years after that 21st century was imagined to have fewer young people coming out of college and companies competing to offer them jobs. However, the opposite has happened and unemployment has risen.

                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons for unemployment is the developing computer industry, which has led to automation of many operations. Countless jobs, previously carried out by humans, were eliminated. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Another explanation is globalization with its improvement of transport, communication and international cooperation. Many offices have been shut down because of the possibility to cut down on expenses and move to cheaper countries. Cheap imports have also impacted many jobs catastrophically.

                    Companies are constantly under pressure to keep their prices down. This could be easier by employing less people. Every company seeks a way do downsize. Another way is to outsource particular jobs, such as cleaning and catering to other companies instead of employing their own employers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unemployment is also affected by the continuously closing jobs because of debts. Governments try to spend as less as possible.

                <p>
                    It was expected that as technology improved, people would be able to work fewer hours and enjoy more leisure time. Instead, working hours have increased. While those who have jobs work longer, there are many people who have no work at all. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some top economists now suggest that if we made the working week shorter, there would be more job places available and quality of life will go up. With that incomes would go down, but people would have more time to enjoy life and spend time with their family. With that people would become volunteers to work for the benefit of society. Robert Gray of NEF (New Economics Foundation) has said that there is too big of a difference between people who have tons of work and those who have little to no work. The solution is work-sharing.
