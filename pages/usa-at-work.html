                <p>
                    The silicon valley is world’s most important center for businesses involved in electronics, computers, software and the Internet. It is a 25 by 10 mile area around the city of San Jose. The name comes from the material, silicone, used to make semiconductors, which are vital for all electronic equipment.
Until the 1950s the area was an agricultural region but when NASA set up research facilities there, it started transforming into an area for electronics. Soon there were hundreds of new companies there, competing and stimulating each other. This led to an electronic evolution, which has led to the modern age of Internet. Silicon valley has developed a reputation for youthful, fresh, innovative and original ideas, combined with a relaxing working atmosphere. Although many new companies risk going bankrupt quickly, investors keep pouring money into the industry.
