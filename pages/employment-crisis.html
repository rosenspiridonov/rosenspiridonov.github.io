                <p>
                    Back in the 1970s wonderful employment prospects were predicted. After the dropped birth rate after
                    WWII and the baby boom years after that 21st century was imagined to have fewer young people coming
                    out of college and companies competing to offer them jobs. However, the opposite has happened and
                    unemployment has risen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons for unemployment is the developing computer industry, which has led to automation
                    of many operations. Countless jobs, previously carried out by humans, were eliminated.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Another explanation is globalization with its improvement of transport, communication and
                    international cooperation. Many offices have been shut down because of the possibility to cut down
                    on expenses and move to cheaper countries. Cheap imports have also impacted many jobs
                    catastrophically.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Companies are constantly under pressure to keep their prices down. This could be easier by employing
                    less people. Every company seeks a way do downsize. Another way is to outsource particular jobs,
                    such as cleaning and catering to other companies instead of employing their own employers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unemployment is also affected by the continuously closing jobs because of debts. Governments try to
                    spend as less as possible.

                    It was expected that as technology improved, people would be able to work fewer hours and enjoy more
                    leisure time. Instead, working hours have increased. While those who have jobs work longer, there
                    are many people who have no work at all.
                </p>

                    Some top economists now suggest that if we made the working week shorter, there would be more job
                    places available and quality of life will go up. With that incomes would go down, but people would
                    have more time to enjoy life and spend time with their family. With that people would become
                    volunteers to work for the benefit of society. Robert Gray of NEF (New Economics Foundation) has
                    said that there is too big of a difference between people who have tons of work and those who have
                    little to no work. The solution is work-sharing.

                    The pool of available workers may be the most pressing concern about the future of the U.S. labor
                    market, experts agree, based on newly released federal government data. The labor force
                    participation rate is projected to continue to trend down, declining from 61.7 percent in 2020 to
                    60.4 percent in 2030, with retiring Baby Boomers and a declining population rate reducing the number
                    of people available to work, according to a new analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
                    The youngest Boomers will reach traditional retirement age by 2030.

                <h2 class="heading-underline uppercase h2">Pandemic Recovery Will Fuel Some Growth</h2>
                <p>
                    The BLS found that the U.S. will add 11.9 million jobs through 2030, but that projection reflects
                    the recovery from the 2020 recession and an abnormally low base-year employment for 2020 associated
                    with the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Total employment is projected to increase about 7.8 percent by 2030, to 165.4 million jobs, equating
                    to just over 1 million new jobs each year, about half the annual gain in the past decade.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "It's about 100,000 new jobs per month," Hetrick said. "That's a reasonable number, but I don't see
                    where those jobs are being filled. The BLS is forecasting 11.9 million new jobs but only 8.9 million
                    new entrants to the labor force. And a lower labor force participation rate that keeps declining. So
                    who will fill these jobs?"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most employment gains through 2030 are expected to occur in the service sectors, which are projected
                    to reach about 134.1 million jobs in 2030. This increase represents just over 95 percent of all jobs
                    added from 2020 to 2030.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Employment in leisure and hospitality is projected to grow the fastest within the service sector,
                    largely driven by recovery from the pandemic. Restaurant cooks are among the fastest-growing
                    occupations, for example, due to substantial employment losses in 2020.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Leisure and hospitality will bounce back, but they will continue to struggle with the talent
                    shortage," Kelly said. "During the initial stages of the pandemic, when that sector was hit the
                    hardest, a number of those displaced workers were diverted into new careers, like call centers and
                    logistics, and many are going to stay in those roles."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hetrick added that eventually some of the 1.5 million job openings in restaurants and hospitality
                    will be filled, but "to think that what is happening now isn't a systemic long-term problem for the
                    sector is na√Øve."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    About one-third of the jobs created, or 3.9 million, will be in low-wage work that pays less than
                    $32,000 a year, exposing another troubling gap in the labor market, Hetrick said. "We have 6.5 to 7
                    million job openings for roles that don't require a college degree but only 2.8 million unemployed
                    people without a college degree. Where will the explosion of lower-skilled labor come from?"
